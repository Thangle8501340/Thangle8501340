    "description": "I moved to Boston when I was 9 as a permanent resident. I was a shy kid in a new country, so I mostly stayed home instead of hanging out with friends. That's when I started tearing apart electronics around the house (much to my parents' dismay) just to see how they worked—and yeah, I never really put them back together. That's when my curiosity to know everything about everything really kicked in."

    "description": "After two years in America and barely knowing English, I somehow managed to take the Independent School Entrance Exam (ISEE). Lucky for me, that opened the door to Boston Latin School, a prestigious exam school near the heart of Boston. While I was there, I took a high school CS class and totally fell in love with coding. My first shot at programming was a Python script I wrote during the summer after 10th grade to figure out what grades I needed on my tests to do well in my classes (though, to be honest, I still failed)."

However, due to the significant commitment required to become a doctor (shoutout to all past, current, and future doctors), I eventually had to choose between coding and pursuing a medical career."
